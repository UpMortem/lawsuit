Hey team,

I just wanted to elaborate a bit on what Raj mentioned in his email. Raj is
currently 2 months into a Bipolar 1 manic episode. Historically his
episodes have lasted around 6 months. Even with the proper medication
prescribed by his psychiatrist, there are still symptoms. The medicine
helps keep things from escalating into further mania, but he unfortunately
still has a lot of the symptoms. For an idea of what the symptoms are like,
you can see this article (under the Mania section).

https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/bipolar-disorder/symptoms/

Manic episodes manifest differently for different people. Some people start
DIY projects, some focus on creating a lot of art, others engage in other
risky behavior. For Raj it has always been coming up with new business
ideas and starting new businesses. This has happened in his past episodes,
and he becomes so focused and it gets ingrained into his thoughts that he
focuses all of his efforts on it.

I know it is a bit of a gray area for medical leave, but once he starts
coming down from his episode and his thoughts return to normal the business
ideas start to dissipate and he returns to his normal life.

I'm happy to answer any further questions there may be.

-Jovan
