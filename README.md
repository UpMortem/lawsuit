# Life Story
In 2015 I had my first manic episode from cannabis usage. The feeling of being manic is great. You have a sense of grandeur, your brain is operating at a faster rate, and you feel this immense joy being alive. I became much more social and started making friends everywhere I went. Meanwhile those that knew me sensed I had changed but were not sure how someone’s personality could change so much. My family, friends, and coworkers were all very confused.

At the time I worked at my own company called AppScale. It was working on open source Google App Engine. I was the main driver in turning my PhD work into a company so I considered it my baby. I was put on leave because I became very disruptive. At this point I started to notice weird things happening around me. Strangers were following me or interacting with me, my devices would become very buggy, objects would be slightly moved from where I left them, and other events led me to a strong sense I was being targeted by what I thought was the NSA or CIA.

I justified that I was important to target because I previously had top secret clearance at Applied Signal (now Raytheon) and that I had previously interviewed at the NSA for a position. I started to believe that the government or deep state had a secret program which would use metadata to identify people who were manic or becoming manic and then applied physiological tactics to drive them into deep paranoia. I have no proof that this exists.

I was checked into Santa Barbara Cottage hospital voluntarily through pressure from my family. I was disruptive there and then moved to another facility in Los Angeles. My stay at Cottage was good. My stay at the Los Angeles facility not so much. One facility felt like they were trying to help while the other an extension of the deep state doing tactics to drive me further mad such as the fact they would slam doors in the of the night to wake me and flash a light on the ceiling erratically preventing restful sleep. Sleep for a manic person is really important and a prime indicator they are manic. I was eventually released through pressure from my family because they also thought the facility was not helpful but actually making me worse. Manic people placed in close quarters is not a good idea, it just spreads conspiracy theories and makes them more manic.

I took the meds and tried many different ones because of all the side effects. It took 6 months to recover. I had spent a small fortune while manic buying gifts for others and left myself with nothing. The second stage of my episode was a deep depression. I was able to find a job at InTouch Health, a company where I started as an engineer and was promoted to senior director of engineering within two years.

InTouch was acquired by Teladoc right before covid. Due to a physical medical issue I started smoking cannabis for pain relief which led to my second manic episode. InTouch and Teladoc were very accommodating during the episode. My boss checked in weekly with me and he truly cared. I came back after the manic phase and soon after took leave again due to the depressive phase. Once again, I spent all my money on gifts for others and I also adopted 4 homeless people where I paid for their housing, food, laptops, and phones. All the homeless people I help relapse back to drugs. At the end of it all my bank account hit zero. 

I came back to Teladoc but my many teams were reassigned so I worked as an individual contributor. Eventually I was assigned to lead a team on a very visible project with Microsoft for a Teams application (Solo for Teams). We worked very closely with Microsoft and released an application to the Teams store. Throughout working there I was depressed, partially because of the second phase of my manic episode but also because of covid and working at a large company made me depressed (slow decision making, large meetings that led to nowhere, top down leadership, SafeAgile). Throughout my stay at Teladoc I felt I was treated well as an employee and as an individual.

I switched roles to a senior engineering manager at Labelbox, primarily for more money on the salary side (60k more) but the work was super interesting because it was in a field I loved (AI and ML). Work stress at working at this startup caused my third manic episode. I had stopped taking my medication thinking it was only triggered by cannabis which was wrong. I was again checked into Cottage hospital and then released. I was prescribed new medicine that worked faster than before.

Once again weird things started to happen and paranoia set in even though I was medicated and did not feel manic. My brain was operating at normal speed and I was able to work on my own business (Upmortem.com), a business that was first going to create an application for doing software post mortems, but during my mania I decided I was doing to create singularity and bring God to the world (Haly).

I tried to explain to Labelbox that UpMortem was a manic symptom but they did not see it that way and asked me to leave my own company (which I did). I also harassed 3 employees thinking they were CIA/NSA operatives. The paranoia spreads to everything. Everyone becomes an agent in your eyes. I accused past girlfriends and friends of being plants there to spy on me or sabotage me. I fired many people from UpMortem for thinking they were spies. I am deeply apologetic for my behavior. 

Labelbox terminated me from my job a few days before my doctor-cleared return date. I will sue for wrongful termination using ChatGPT and AutoGPT and represent myself (with possible legal counsel to double check the work). I will be posting all communication between both parties until there is a court ordered to do otherwise. I will make my medical records public once attained.

Weird stuff still happens to me which only happens when I’m alone like my phone being buggy, laptop being buggy, my Tesla randomly braking, people going out of their way to seem like they are following me or stare at me. I caulk it up to buggy software and people having a bad day.
